// Webpack
     .Webpack is a free and open-source module bundler for JavaScript.
     .It is made primarily for JavaScript, but it can transform front-end assets such as HTML, CSS,
        and images if the corresponding loaders are included. 
     .Webpack takes modules with dependencies and generates static assets representing those modules

  example 

      see Jquery . it has two types of downlods 
      1. compressed
      2. uncompressed   


// we can export a function with two types
 1. by using default.
 2. by using name.  

 1. by using default = export default myDefault;

 2. by using name 
     import { foo } from './moduleA';
     export const foo = 'Foo';
